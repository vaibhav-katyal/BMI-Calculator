        <p>
        Body Mass Index (BMI) is a widely used tool to assess whether an individual’s weight is appropriate for their height. It provides a numerical value that helps determine if a person falls within a general healthy weight range. BMI is calculated by dividing a person’s weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. While BMI doesn’t measure body fat directly, it serves as a useful screening tool to identify potential weight-related health risks. <br>

        Health professionals often use BMI to monitor population health and track changes in weight trends over time. By providing a simple calculation, BMI can offer insight into whether an individual may need to consider changes in their diet, physical activity, or lifestyle. Instead of limitations, BMI offers several benefits, including its ease of use and its ability to provide a quick, non-invasive measurement. <br>

        As a widely accepted standard, BMI is effective in large-scale health studies and public health initiatives. It helps identify at-risk populations and can support the development of preventive health strategies. BMI is also accessible, requiring only basic measurements of weight and height, making it a practical tool for individuals and healthcare providers alike. Although not a perfect measurement, BMI remains a valuable resource for assessing general health and encouraging proactive health management. <br>
